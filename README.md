# Jagadam

**Developed by- Vidhur Voora**

**Jagadam** is a Unity based VR FPS game. 

It can be experienced using the **Oculus Rift with touch controllers**. Support for other controllers like Vive and Oculus Go will be added in future

**Project Idea**
The idea behind the project was to create a FPS shooting app after experiencing Robo Recall on Oculus Store.
This project tries to bring together the core elements of a shooter game which is gun management, enemy spawning, weapon managemnt, ammo and health pickup, choice of different "flavor" of experiences etc..

**Emotion Conveyed**
The  emotion which this experienes offers is **"Courage" & "Fight"** the fears

***Video Walkthrough***: Video of the project with captions can be found [here](https://youtu.be/aGTOA9kUS_M "here")

**Different Aspects  Incorporated**

***FUNDAMENTALS***

- ***Scale Achievement*** : The enemies at farther distance are smaller and as they approach nearer the size becomes bigger. The pickup and other elements also appear smaller when they are farther away.

- ***Animation Achievement***: Lots of animations are incorportated in the game, like the gun firing animation, zombie movement animation

- ***Light Achievemnet*** :  This project utilizes  the direct light in the project

- ***Locomotion Achievement*** : Locomation is utilized heavily in this project as  this is a first person shooter game. This project utilized the VRTK library for oculus camera and locomotion management

- ***Physics Achievement*** : Physics is also utilized heavily in this project for player gun bullets, enemy weapon colliding, ammo pickup etc..

- ***Empathy Achievement***  : The project tried to showcase Empathy in a different angle, the fear of facing Zombie and provides the courage to face the fear strongly.

- ***Other Achievements***  : The project also incorporates bunch of other add-ons like particle effects, background sound etc..

***COMPLETENESS***

- ***Gamification Achievement***  : The project is a FPS game, there are many elements of gamification like Ammo pickup at various points for guns to refill bullets, Health refill, Enemy health tracker etc..

- ***Diegetic UI Achievement*** : The project has tried to incorporate very less UI elements and has been made straightforward. There were few elements incorporated as part of the User study.

- ***Alternative Storyline achievement*** : The game offers differentt storyline or "flavors" via startup menu options, where the user can choose to play against Robots, or Zombies or play against both Robots & Zombies.

- ***AI Achievement*** : The game heavily relies on Unity AI system, for enemies to look at player and move to the player to attack via Nav Mesh Agent

***CHALLENGES***

- ***User Testing Achievement***  : This game has been user tested on **2** users and the learnings from the tests have been incorporated into the game, like better UI display for ammunition left in guns and  health for main player and enemies. Menu buttons hover indicator etc..

- ***Compute Shader Achievement*** : Added a simple custom compute shader which inverts the colors. Added it to a custom material and applied to the player bullets. This was useful learning first step towards shader development

**Things I like about this project**
I enjoyed working on various elements of this project like ammunition logic, pickup logic enemy logic, introducing different types of enemy etc. Hoping to refine this and support other devices  like Vive and Oculus Go in future.
